== Partition Plugin

This partition uses native database techniques to partition tables based on field values.

Currently this plugin only works for Postgres and will only partition based on a date or string field.

== Postgres Notes

In order for postgres partitioning to work most effectively, you need to make sure you have 
constraint_exclusion set to 'on' or 'partition' in your postgresql.conf

You'll also need to add the following monkey-patch:

  class ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter
    # partition triggers can't return values. :(
    def supports_insert_with_returning?
      false
    end
  end
